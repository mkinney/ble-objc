This is a temp repo to see if I can get bluetooth working from python for the Meshtastic-python repo.

Note: I borrowed the generated protobufs from another project, but I hope to enventually use the generated protobufs in the Meshtastic-python repo.

pip install pyobjc-framework-CoreBluetooth protobuf
